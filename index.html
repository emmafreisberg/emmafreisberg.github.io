<h3> Weclome to my website! Here we will go over: <h3>
<p> My academic journey at UW-Madison. I'm a sophmore currently majoring in Health Promotion & Health Equity and Information Science at UW. I am particularly interested in how we can use data analysis and a deeper understanding of user experiences to eliminate health disparities and promote postive health changes. After my fourth semester, I plan to add a certificate in German. Post-graduation, I am planning on getting my Masters in Public Health in Germany, or somewhere else abroad. </p>
