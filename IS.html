				<h2>What is Information Science?</h2>
				<p>Information Science is another new major at UW-Madison, which aims to help students understand the intersections of technolgy, such as digital information or data, and humans. This major seeks to help those of us creating or using these systems to make the processes surrounding technology more equitable, accessible, and positive for the world. Studens within this major can focus their interests and understanding through many different courses, such as focusing on computing or data analysis, or user experiences, or increasing understanding of the social impacts of technology. </p>

				<h3>Why Information Science?</h3>
					<p>As I prepare to enter the field of public health, I also understand that in today's world, it is incredibly important to have knowledge and background in computing, technology, and human interactions. I seek to understand how we can use data to better understand public and global health. Both qualitative and quantitative data are incredibly important pieces of how we understand public health as well as in creating meaningful solutions. I believe that understanding how to use and create both will provide me with the skills necessary to contribute to the successes of global health today. Additionally, in an ever-technology driven world, it is important to understand how people's interactions with technology can shape their health, or views on health.</p>
