				<h2>What is HPHE?</h2>
					<p> Health Promotion and Health Equity is a relatively new major at UW-Madison in the School of Education. It connects kinesiology, counseling psychology, and rehabilitation psychology to educate students on how to promote health in their communities and focuses primarily on developing the skills and knowledge necessary to eliminate health disparities. Students are able to tailor their coursework towards whatever pathway they wish to go with the major, but all students will have the ability to work within systems to promote equity in health. </p>

				<h2>Why HPHE?</h2>
				<p>In my first semester at university, I had the opprotunity to participate in a global reproductive politics seminar. It was in this class that I came to recognize that working in reproductive and sexual health is what I am truly passionate about. After looking into degrees at Wisconsin that would allow me to study this and truly understand what I can do for my communities in this regard, I found HPHE!  </p>
