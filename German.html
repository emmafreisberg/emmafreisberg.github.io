				<h2>Why German?</h2>
					<p>I am a German-American dual citizen who did not have the opprotunity to learn German growing up. Growing up, the impact that this had on my relationship with family members who could only speak German comfortably, was immense. Now, I hope to communicate with my family in new, meaningful ways and connect with them in a way that goes further than baseline communication. Now, with this skill, I hope to continue developing my German language to live closer to my family and study in Germany in the future. I hope to take advantage of the many global connections I could make with this skill, as well. It is a dream of mine to live in Berlin, as I've been a couple times now!</p>

				<h3>Language and Global Health</h3>
					<p>Speaking multiple languages opens many doors when engaging in the field of global health. Having this skill, no matter what the language, opens the opprotunity to engage with and learn from a larger group of people, which is essential when working in global health. </p>
