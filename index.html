<h3> Weclome to my website! Here we will go over: <h3>
<p> My academic journey at UW-Madison. I'm a sophmore currently majoring in Health Promotion & Health Equity and Information Science at UW. I'm also studying German and am planning to take on the certificate after my fourth semester. I am particularly interested in the intersections between HPHE and Information Science, and how those will lead me to Public Health. </p>
